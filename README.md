# Emotion-detector-using-facial-expression
This Python script uses OpenCV and a deep learning model to detect and classify facial emotions in real-time from webcam input. It identifies the largest face, predicts emotion using a trained Keras model, smooths predictions using a deque, and displays color-coded results with emotion labels on screen.
